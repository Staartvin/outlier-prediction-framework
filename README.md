# outlier-prediction-framework
This is the code used during my graduation project. It resulted in the thesis "Using human mobility patterns to forecast outliers in a secondary stream of data".

The goal of the framework was to predict outliers from one stream, using a secondary stream of data. 
Two use cases have been tested:
- The primary use case was using two datasets, one with complaints and one with traffic. 
- The second use case used a single dataset of traffic volume data from the Dutch city of The Hague. 


Note 1:
This project makes extensive use of matplotlib, pandas, plotly and dash. 

Note 2:
All the input data has been removed as it is either confidential (in case of use case 2), or it too large to share (use case 1). Be sure to look for the data online!
